# Basic Todo List

This project was to mainly get familar with how to handle basic CRUD operation using the React framework. I also practiced using ```useState()``` as well as ```useEffect()```.

## ```useEffect()```
```useEffect()``` was used to be able to use local storage in order to store all of the todos using the browsers local storage. This when even after refreshing, all the todos will still be there. 

## ```useState()```
```useState()``` was used to manage the state of the application, specifically for handling the list of todos and the currently selected tab. 

## Basic Features
This application allows users to:
1. Add new todos
2. Mark todos as complete
3. Delete todos
